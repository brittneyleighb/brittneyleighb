## About me
Yes, I'm a HUGE Star Wars fan.

What else? Well...Some background: After taking a UX Design course,  I wanted to get an edge for interviews and thought some basic coding skills would help. I tried Harvard CS50 thinking I'd probably find it boring, and LOVED it. It was incredibly challenging, but after about three months of hard work (and basically making it my full-time job), I passed.

I spent the next two years dabbling in various coding languages, but struggling to choose a direction, as I was just fascinated by it all. My ADHD can be a hyperfocusing superpower, but if not supplemented with copious amounts of cardio exercise, it can scatter me. Somehow found myself surfing & hiking in the tropics of Taiwan, wallowing around as I tried to save money in my transition out of education, teaching English, my software engineering dreams quashed by insecure micromanagement and loads of pointless paperwork in wayward for-profit schools, and here I am, back in coding dreamland (two screens and plenty of time to study), finally focusing on app development with JavaScript.

- ðŸ”­ My goal is to master JavaScript.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about creative coding.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on app development.
